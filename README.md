 # Mind Reader
 
 Mind Reader was the third project of the program that was assigned,to which I had an entire week to complete it in its 
 totality. The project consist of code a program that generates a random 4 digit number. Once the random number is generated 
 the program allows the user to guess the random number for an ulimited amount of tries. The user will have a hint after each guess 
 they make. The hint consists of a statement that is printed after each guess of the user that tells them if they got any 
of the digits in their guess correct. Once they guessed the random number the program will ask them if they would like to play 
again, if they want to play again the program resets and starts a new  game with a new random number,but if they don't want 
to play again the program stops and prints them a farewell statement.
This project rellay help me to have a better understanding of how for loops work and how they can be very helpful when 
creating a program like this where you might require a tool to check every character of a string for a specific number of times.
